Here are some explanations for error codes you may encounter. Please let us know if you think you
encountered a bug.

403 - Forbidden

as user with a **read only** group. The user interface shouldn't provide you with links to sites
that are restricted for your user. Maybe you used an obsolete link or bookmark.

404 - File not found
--------------------

The site you requested cannot be found. Maybe you used an obsolete link or bookmark.

418 - Iâ€™m a teapot
------------------

You see this message if you tried to access an entity with an id that doesn't exist (anymore).
Maybe you used an obsolete link or bookmark.
