Wrong Password
--------------

You can activate the **show password** checkbox to see the entered password and make sure that the
problem isn't keyboard related, e.g. capslock is turned on.

You can request a new password when clicking
**Forgot your password?** which is located under login button if email was set up.


No user with this name found.
-----------------------------

Either you misspelled the username or the user doesn't exist (anymore).

If there is a **Forgot your password?** link below the login you can request a new password with
the email you are registered with. With the new password you'll also receive your username.

This user is not activated.
---------------------------

Your user was deactivated. If you think this to be a mistake please contact your project manager.

Too many login attempts.
------------------------

For security reasons (e.g. automatic attacks) the login gets locked after a few failed attempts.
Number of failed attempts and minutes to wait until you can try again depend on project specific
settings but in most cases you can try again after a few minutes.
