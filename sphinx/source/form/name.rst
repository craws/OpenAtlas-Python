The name field is one of the few required fields which are marked with an asterisk.

It's quite important since it is used to find entries in tables or with the global :doc:`/tools/search`.

Duplicate names are allowed but if they don't differ in e.g. the standard type, it could be
difficult to find the right one in a table.
