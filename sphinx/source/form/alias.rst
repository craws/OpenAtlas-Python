Alias
=====

.. toctree::

To document different spellings of entities (e.g. actors or places) aliases can be used.

When first editing an entity there is only one alias field available. If you need more then one you
can save the form with one alias and when editing again you'll have an additional alias field.

This can be done as often as needed. If you want to delete one, just empty the field.
